8. **Production performance analysis**  

## What This Page Is

This is the **reference page** - the canonical list of activities as defined by ISA-95 Part 3.

- For **conceptual understanding** → [[Understanding ISA-95 Activity Model]]
- For **our implementation mapping** → [[System Architecture Overview#Activity Model Mapping]]
- For **specific activity details** → Individual activity pages (see below)

## Cross-Reference Pattern

According to [[ISA-95 Activity Model - Page Organization]], this reference page is the "WHAT" - listing the activities as defined by the standard. For deeper understanding:

```
Reference (this page) → Understanding → Implementation → Deep Dives
     ↓                      ↓               ↓              ↓
   WHAT                   WHY           WHERE         DETAILS
```
