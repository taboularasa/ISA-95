# ISA-95 Detailed Production Scheduling Flashcards

## Definition and Purpose

What is Detailed Production Scheduling according to ISA-95 Section 6.6.1?
?
The collection of activities that take the production schedule and determine the optimal use of local resources to meet the production schedule requirements.

Detailed Production Scheduling takes the production schedule from ==Level 4== and optimizes for ==local resources and constraints==.

Why do enterprise-level planning systems often need Detailed Production Scheduling at Level 3?::Enterprise-level planning systems often do not have the detailed information required to schedule specific work centers, work units, or personnel

## Key Activities

What are the key activities included in Detailed Production Scheduling?
?
- Ordering equipment and production requests
- Calculating cleaning requirements
- Merging requests for optimal equipment use
- Splitting requests based on batch sizes or production rates
- Considering local resource availability

Detailed Production Scheduling may split requests when required because of ==batch sizes== or ==limited production rates==.

## Optimization Considerations

What local factors does Detailed Production Scheduling take into account?
?
- Local situations
- Resource availability
- Equipment constraints
- Cleaning/changeover requirements
- Batch size limitations

Detailed Production Scheduling involves ==merging requests== for optimal use of equipment and ==splitting requests== when required by constraints.

## Level Interactions

From which level does Detailed Production Scheduling receive the production schedule?::Level 4 (Enterprise level)

At which level does Detailed Production Scheduling operate?::Level 3 (Manufacturing Operations Management)

The gap that Detailed Production Scheduling fills is between ==business planning== and ==shop floor execution==.

## Relationship to Other Activities

Which activity provides input to Production Dispatching after optimization?::Detailed Production Scheduling

Detailed Production Scheduling bridges the gap between the ==production schedule== (from L4) and ==Production Dispatching== (in L3).

## Work Schedule Concepts

What is a Work Schedule in ISA-95 context?
?
A schedule of work orders for a specific work center or station, optimized for local constraints and resources

Work Schedules contain ==multiple work orders== and are typically organized per ==station or work center==.

## Scheduling Intelligence

What is the difference between having Work Schedule structure and Detailed Production Scheduling?
?
- Work Schedule structure: The data model/container for scheduled work
- Detailed Production Scheduling: The logic/intelligence that optimizes and prioritizes work within those schedules

The missing piece in many implementations is not the work schedule structure, but the ==scheduling intelligence== that optimizes across all station work schedules.

## ISA-95 Job Concepts

Job Order (ISA-95)::Contains the details needed to execute work at the shop floor level

Job Response (ISA-95)::Contains the outcomes/results of executed work

What is the relationship between Work Schedule and Job Orders?
?
A Work Schedule contains multiple Job Orders, each representing specific work to be executed at a work center

## Design Considerations

What are the key requirements for a Detailed Production Scheduling system from ISA-95 perspective?
?
1. Local Resource Awareness (equipment, personnel, materials)
2. Optimization Capabilities (batch merging, splitting, sequencing)
3. Integration Points (input from L4, output to dispatching, feedback from tracking)

Why is Production Tracking (Activity 7) important for Detailed Production Scheduling?::Without knowing actual vs planned performance, scheduling optimization cannot adapt or improve - it's "flying blind"

## Common Challenges

What is the L3/L4 boundary challenge in Detailed Production Scheduling?
?
The standard assumes clear boundaries, but modern systems often need more fluid interactions between enterprise scheduling (L4) and detailed local optimization (L3)

Detailed Production Scheduling handles ==local optimization== that enterprise systems cannot see or manage effectively.
