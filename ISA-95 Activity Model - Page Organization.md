# ISA-95 Activity Model - Page Organization

## Page Separation Strategy

### 1. ISA-95 Part 3 Activity Model Reference
**Purpose**: The canonical reference - just the facts from the standard
- Lists the 8 activities exactly as defined in ISA-95
- Shows Figure 6 from the standard
- Tracks our study progress
- Links to individual activity deep dives

**This is the "WHAT" page**

### 2. Understanding ISA-95 Activity Model  
**Purpose**: Conceptual understanding and intuition
- Explains WHY activities matter
- HOW to think about activities vs systems
- Common pitfalls and design patterns
- The network nature of activities
- How to use the model for system design

**This is the "WHY and HOW TO THINK" page**

### 3. System Architecture Overview (Activity Model Mapping section)
**Purpose**: Our specific implementation
- Maps each activity to our actual systems
- Shows gaps and overlaps
- Identifies where activities are split between systems

**This is the "WHERE WE PUT THEM" page**

### 4. Individual Activity Deep Dives (e.g., Product Definition Management)
**Purpose**: Detailed analysis of specific activities
- Deep dive into one activity's responsibilities
- How we implement it
- Integration challenges
- Deviations from standard

**These are the "DEEP DIVE" pages**

## Cross-Reference Pattern

```
Reference → Understanding → Implementation → Deep Dives
    ↓            ↓                ↓              ↓
  WHAT         WHY            WHERE         DETAILS
```

Each page has a specific purpose and links to others for different perspectives.
