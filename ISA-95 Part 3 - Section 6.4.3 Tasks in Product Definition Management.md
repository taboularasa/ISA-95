# ISA-95 Part 3 - Section 6.4.3 Tasks in Product Definition Management

*Part of the [[ISA-95 Part 3 Activity Model Reference|Eight Generic Activity Functions]]*

## Overview
Product Definition Management is one of the eight core production activities in ISA-95's Level 3 operations management. It serves as the bridge between what the business wants to produce (Level 4) and how production actually executes (Level 2).

This activity is central to the **Product Definition Flow** described in [[Information Flows – Enterprise ↔ Control  (ISA-95 Part 3 §6 & Figure 6)|ISA-95's four canonical information flows]].

## Key Interfaces (from Figure 7)

### Inputs:
- **Product Definition** (from Level 4)
- **Equipment and process specific production rules** (from Level 1-2)
- **KPI Definitions** (from Production Analysis)

### Outputs:
- **Product Definition** (to Production Dispatching)
- **Work Master** (to Production Dispatching) - contains work center specific product production rules and detailed production routing
- **Detailed Production Scheduling** (bidirectional interface)
- **Production Execution Management** (receives production definitions)

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Product Information Management
- Maintains master data about what can be produced
- Translates enterprise product definitions into manufacturing-specific formats
- Manages product specifications, tolerances, and quality requirements

### 2. Work Master Development
- Creates work center-specific production rules
- Defines detailed production routing
- Specifies equipment capabilities and constraints
- Maps abstract product requirements to concrete production steps

### 3. Production Rule Management
- Manages equipment and process-specific production rules
- Ensures compatibility between product requirements and equipment capabilities
- Maintains version control for production specifications

## Mapping to Our Architecture

See [[System Architecture Overview]] for complete system details.

### Where Product Definition Management Lives
In our architecture, Product Definition Management functionality resides in **FES (Factory Execution System)** at Level 3. This makes sense because:
- FES has direct knowledge of equipment capabilities
- It manages the translation from business language to production language
- It maintains work masters and production rules

### Key Integration Points
FES must integrate with multiple Level 4 systems:
- **[[System Architecture Overview#Part Service|Part Service]]**: Product structure, variants, BOM
- **[[System Architecture Overview#Reference Services|Reference Services]]**: Materials, tools, quality specs
- **[[System Architecture Overview#Quote-to-Order (QTO)|QTO]]**: Commercial context and constraints
- **[[System Architecture Overview#DFM (Design for Manufacturability)|DFM]]**: Manufacturability validation

## Insights from Requirements Meeting (2025-06-16)

Our team identified key tensions that map directly to ISA-95 concepts:

### The "Process Independence" Debate
- **Challenge**: Should process definitions be equipment-agnostic?
- **Current State**: Work orders used as templates, mixing process and equipment
- **ISA-95 Solution**: Separate Process Masters (HOW) from Equipment Routing (WHERE)

### Scalability Concerns
- "Don't want to manage 10 different process masters for one part"
- Need abstraction layer between process definition and equipment execution
- ISA-95's Work Master concept provides this abstraction

### Recommended Design Pattern
```
Process Master (abstract HOW)
    ↓
+ Equipment Capabilities
    ↓
= Work Master (executable)
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Process Master = equipment-agnostic definition
   - Equipment Model = machine capabilities
   - Work Master = executable combination

2. **Inheritance Model**
   - Changes to Process Master cascade
   - Equipment-specific overrides isolated
   - Version control at each level

3. **Integration Architecture**
   - FES queries Part Service for product structure
   - FES queries Reference Services for manufacturing data
   - FES combines both to create Work Masters

## Areas of Divergence from ISA-95

1. **Distributed Product Data**: ISA-95 assumes centralized product definition; we have it spread across multiple L4 systems
2. **Bridge Systems**: DFM operates between levels, challenging the hierarchy
3. **Customer Variants**: More complex than ISA-95's simple product model
4. **Real-time Integration**: Need for synchronous capability checking
